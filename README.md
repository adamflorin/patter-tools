![Patter Tools](icon.png)

**Patter Tools** contains a minimal, open-source generative
sequencer based on the Max For Live device
[Patter](http://playpatter.com/) and supporting Max externals and patchers, including [`[cue]`](https://github.com/adamflorin/cue),
[`[normalrandom]`](https://github.com/adamflorin/normalrandom).

This patcher was originally developed for workshops given at Moogfest 2016.
