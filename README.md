# Patter Tools

**Patter Tools** includes a minimal, open-source generative
sequencer based on the Max For Live device
[Patter](http://playpatter.com/) and the Max externals that
make it work: [`[cue]`](https://github.com/adamflorin/cue) and
[`[normalrandom]`](https://github.com/adamflorin/normalrandom).
