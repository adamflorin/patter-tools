# Patter Tools

**Patter Tools** contains a minimal, open-source generative
sequencer based on the Max For Live device
[Patter](http://playpatter.com/) and a few Max externals and patchers that make
it work, including [`[cue]`](https://github.com/adamflorin/cue),
[`[normalrandom]`](https://github.com/adamflorin/normalrandom).
